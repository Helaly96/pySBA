# pySBA - Python Bundle Adjustment
Python Implementation for Simple Bundle Adjustment

## Project
The project aims to provide a simple, reachable approach for the implementation of a Sparse Bundle Adjustment. Giving any new comer to the field of computer vision the ability to implement an optimization algorithm, which is very complex to create from scratch. The project is done in Python because of its relative ease of use and because Bundle Adjustment implementations are scarce in the language.

## Collaborations
One of the goals is for developers to help expand this library/project in order to have a robust framework which permits everyone to have access to some of the most powerful optimization algorithms.  

## This project is still in development. 
Theoretically, it should work if the correct formated parameters are used as input.
##Hopefully will finish soon :)
